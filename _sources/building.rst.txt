Building from source
********************

The following sections contain instructions for building MAD-X and cpymad from
source on various platforms. This can be an intricate procedure that is mostly
performed by package maintainers or developers who want to change cpymad code.
Ordinary users usually don't need to do this and can use the prebuilt wheels
if available (see :ref:`installation`).
