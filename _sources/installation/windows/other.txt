Other distributions
===================

If you want to build on another python installation things may get more
complicated. You may want to have a look at the following resources:

* :ref:`dependencies` (but without the comfort of a linux package manager)
* MinGW_ as your compiler suite
* `Compiling Python extensions with distutils and MinGW`_
* `Unofficial Windows Binaries for Python Extension Packages`_
