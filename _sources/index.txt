Disclaimer
==========

This is a heavily modified fork of the cern-cpymad_ package. The fork is
not authored or maintained by CERN members.

cpymad links against an unofficial build of MAD-X that is not supported by
CERN, i.e. in case of problems you will not get help there. However, this
does NOT mean you should post every problem you encounter while using
cpymad here. See `Reporting issues`_.
