1.9.0
=====
Date: 01.09.2021


API changes:

- ``Table.selected_rows()`` now actually returns the *indices* of the selected
  elements as documented, rather than returning a boolean mask.
- ``Madx.eval()`` does no automatic syntax checking anymore. This is a minor
  performance improvement and is more consistent with ``Madx.input()`` which
  doesn't check the syntax either. Expressions can still be checked manually
  using ``cpymad.util.check_expression``


New features:

- (#90) Add comparison operators for ArrayAttribute (see #89)
- (#94) Add keyword argument ``Table.dframe(index=..)`` to allow specifying
  a column or sequence as the DataFrame index rather than using the default
  (``row_names()``). This is essential when accessing a table after having
  executed a ``USE`` statement (see #93).
- (#97) Add basic support for unexpanded nested sequences by returning
  them as elements of type ``Sequence`` from ``Sequence.elements`` (see #76)
- Add keyword argument ``Madx(prompt=...)`` as a shortcut for the most common
  ``CommandLog`` use case
- (#99) Add method ``Table.column()`` to retrieve specified rows in a specific
  column.
- (#99) Add ``rows`` and/or ``columns`` arguments to several ``Table`` methods
  to allow querying only specific columns or rows from the MAD-X process
- (#99) Add method ``Table.selection()`` that returns a new ``Table`` object
  which exposes only those rows/columns marked by a previous ``SELECT`` statement
  (see #98)
- Fix ``Madx.eval()`` to handle function calls, e.g.: ``sin(...)`` or ``table(...)``


Bug fixes:

- (#95) Fix ``KeyError`` when accessing tables after ``CLEAR`` (see #57)
- (#99) Fix requesting a subset of table rows using using a *numpy array*
  of indices
- Fix expression syntax checker to not reject function calls anymore. Rewrite
  the checker to use a LL(1) parser generator.


Documentation:

- Add links to external documentation using intersphinx
- Use automodapi to create module and class summary pages
- Use type hints from function annotations in documentation
- Mark more objects for inclusion in the documentation
- Add "Edit on GitHub" link to directly edit documentation
- Add many function annotations
- Generate class inheritance diagrams using graphviz
- Document problem with ``Table.row_names()`` after ``USE`` (#93)

- add ``VarList.defs``, ``Command.defs`` instance variables for accessing the
  definitions (provisional API)
- create the accessor proxies in advance
- disallow indexing ``ElementList`` by ``dict`` instances (i.e. by element
  object)
- handle uppercase '#S' and '#E' in ``ElementList``


1.0.0rc0
========
Date: 16.04.2018

First pre-release for 1.0.0 with several backward incompatibilities.

- the Madx methods have been simplified to be only thin wrappers over the
  corresponding MAD-X commands, not taking any extra responsibilities such as
  automatically using sequences etc.
- rename ``Madx.tables/sequences`` to singular form
- disable passing dicts as range parameter for commands
- remove ``cpymad.util.is_match_param``.
- remove ``cpymad.libmadx.set_var`` routine. Always use ``input``!
- remove ``Madx.get_table`` method, use ``Madx.table.X`` instead
- rename ``Madx.evaluate`` to ``eval``
- remove ``Madx.set_value/set_expression/update_value``. Use assignment to
  attributes of ``Madx.globals/command/element`` instead.
- rename ``util.mad_command`` -> ``format_command``
- only ignore ``None`` parameters when generating MAD-X commands. This allows
  passing empty strings.
- remove ``cpymad.types.Expression``, replaced by new ``Parameter`` class, see
  below.
- remove ``Madx.active_sequence``, use ``Madx.sequence()`` instead
- the ``at/l`` attributes are now kept as the values specified by the user
  (relative to *refer* flag), and not overwritten anymore by the actual
  position or length. Use ``.position`` and ``.length`` attributes to access
  the node position/length instead!
- the ``name`` attribute is now the command/element name. The node name is
  now available as ``node_name``.

Introduced a new API for accessing additional metadata about command
parameters:

- added a ``Command.cmdpar.X`` namespace that can be used to retrieve a
  ``Parameter`` instance with additional metadata about the command parameter.
- rigorously distinguish between MAD-X command parameters and other attributes
  on elements/commands
- only command parameters can be accessed using the dict-like item access
  syntax while other metadata can only be accessed via attribute access
- use the type information for improving the composition of MAD-X command
  statements

Misc changes:

- add method ``Madx.sectortable2`` to access 2nd order sector map (as well as
  related methods to ``Table``). Method name is subject to change!
- show implicit drifts with ``[0]`` again (the suffix is needed when matching
  on implicit drifts)
- perfect kwargs forwarding
- expose ``occ_count/enable/base_name`` attributes on nodes


0.19.1
======
Date: 02.04.2018

- pass unescaped (raw) string arguments to MAD-X
- use double-quotes by default
- overload ``Madx.evaluate`` for floats and lists (making it applicable
  for anything that may be returned in the property)
- windows builds link against MAD-X 49b4e7fee "Fix incorrect field errors
  in tmbend with INTERPOLATE". This is a few minor bugfixes after 5.04.00.


0.19.0
======
Date: 25.03.2018

- command/element etc:
    * retrieve information about commands from MAD-X ``defined_commands`` and
      store in ``Command`` instances.
    * use ``Command`` to improve command string generation and type-checks in
      ``util.mad_command`` (#9)
    * quote filename parameters when composing command string
    * use deferred expressions (``:=``) whenever passing strings to
      non-string parameters (#11)
    * subclass elements, beam from ``Command``
    * support attribute access for table/mappings/commands/elements/beams etc
    * allow case-insensitive access
    * overload index-access in tables to retrieve rows
    * implement ``Element.__delitem__`` by setting value to default
    * return name for global elements too
    * add ``Madx.base_types`` data variable that yields the base elements
    * add ``Element.parent``/``base_type`` attributes
    * more concise string representations
    * strip -Proxy suffix from class names
    * apply user defined row/column selections even when no output file is
      specified

- installation:
    * automatically use ``-lquadmath``
    * add ``--static`` flag for setup script, use ``--shared`` by default
    * no more need to link against PTC shared object separately
    * finally provide some binary wheels for py 3.5 and 3.6 (#32)

- raise cython language_level to 3
- require MAD-X 5.04.00

0.10.8
======
Date: 02.07.2015

  binaries on windows actually useful)
- add MAD-X license notice (required to distribute binaries)
- setup.py doesn't require setuptools to be pre-installed anymore (if
  internet is available)
- some doc-fixes
- convert cpymad._couch to a simple module (was a single file package)

- multi-column access, e.g.: ``table.columns['betx','bety']``
- move tests one folder level up

- isolate cpymad: remove jpymad backend, remove pymad base
- bootstrap the dependency on numpy
- remove custom MAD-X path discovery during setup. You should use
  *--madxdir* if the library is not installed in a system location.
- add function ``libmadx.is_expanded``
- add function ``libmadx.chdir``
- handle MAD-X table columns with integer arrays
- make ``madx.command`` more powerful (allows ``**kwargs`` and attribute
  access)
- use inherited pipes for IPC with remote MAD-X processes (allows to
  forward stdin/stdout separately)
- close connection to remote process on finalization of ``LibMadxClient``
- remove MAD-X command checks, ``recursive_history`` and filename
  completion
- fix name clash
- fix some bugs
- rename convenience constructors to ``cern.cpymad.load_model`` and
  ``cern.cpymad.start_madx`` due to name clash with module names

- close handles in remote process properly on all supported python versions
- rewrite ``libmadx.get_table`` functionality
- madx functions that return tables now return proxy objects instead. For
  backward compatibility these can be iterated to allow unpacking into a tuple
- the returned table columns is now a proxy object as well and not ``TfsTable``
- remove ``retdict`` parameter
- move some cpymad specific functionality into the cpymad package
- add libmadx/madx functions to access list of elements in a sequence

- raise exception and don't hang up anymore, if libmadx process crashes
- on python>=3.4, close handles in remote process properly
- let every 'Madx' instance have an independent copy of the madx library.
  this makes the madx module much more useful. previously, this was only
  true for instances of 'cpymad.model'.
- restrict to only one cython module that links to libmadx. (allows static
  linking which is advantageous on windows!)
- use YAML model files instead of JSON
- make 'madx' a submodule of 'cpymad'
- fix test exit status


0.5
===
Date: 21.01.2014

- migrate to setuptools from distutils
- python3 support
- add continuous integration with Travis
- proper setup.py and MANIFEST.in to be used with PyPI
- rename package to 'cern-pymad'
- allow to build from PyPI without having cython
